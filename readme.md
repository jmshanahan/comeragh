# React Boilerplate

## Introduction

This is a boiler plate for creating react apps. It is similiar to the create-react-app but it is customised to the way I want it to work.

Some of the features are:

- It hs been configured using wepcack and the webback configuration is easily modified. This is not the case with create-react-app
- It has jest for testing build in.
- Formatting with prettier and linting with eslint are customised to work in the way I would like them to work. create-react-app does not include this out of the box.
- It will check for deptecated react functionality.
- Husky is configured to format code , lint code and run tests on commit.
- Accessability is addressed by implementing a11y-eslint plugin

## Acknowledgement

Most of this setup was gleaned from Andy Van Slaars eggehead course Modern JavaScript Tooling with React.

### BTW

If you are a javascript developer eggehead is awesome!!!
